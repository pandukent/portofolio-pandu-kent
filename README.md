Hi! I’m Pandu, a data engineer with over 3 years of experience in the banking industry, where working with accurate, well-structured data is essential. I specialize in building ETL processes, working with cloud data platforms, automating tasks with Python, and creating clear dashboards for better decision-making. I really enjoy building data systems that are not only reliable but also actually useful.

I’ve always enjoyed solving problems with data, and lately, I’ve been really interested in how AI is evolving and starting to play a bigger role in this field. I see AI as a natural next step for someone in data—whether it’s integrating it into data platforms, improving decision-making, or just building smarter systems. I’m starting to explore it more seriously and looking forward to how it can complement and expand what I already do as a data engineer.
